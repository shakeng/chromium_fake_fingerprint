This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test setting target before constructing the associated animation
PASS Test setting target from null to a valid target
PASS Test setting target from a valid target to null
PASS Test setting target from a valid target to another target
PASS Target element can be set to a foreign element
PASS Change target from null to an existing pseudoElement setting target first.
PASS Change target from null to an existing pseudoElement setting pseudoElement first.
PASS Change target from an existing pseudo-element to the originating element.
PASS Change target from an existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting target.
PASS Change target from an existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting pseudoElement.
PASS Change target from a non-existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting target.
PASS Change target from a non-existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting pseudoElement.
FAIL Change target from null to a non-existing pseudoElement setting target first. assert_equals: Value at 50% progress after setting new target expected "50px" but got "10px"
FAIL Change target from null to a non-existing pseudoElement setting pseudoElement first. assert_equals: Value at 50% progress after setting new target expected "50px" but got "10px"
PASS Change target from a non-existing pseudo-element to the originating element.
